# [Main](../README.md) > How To Run

## Install dependencies

Execute `npm i` and wait for completion.

## Development server

Run `npm start` or `npm run serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

If you wanna run the production version, run `npm run serve:prod`.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

For production build, run `npm run build:prod`.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

In order to run it only in CLI without opening a browser instance, execute `npm run test:headless`. This is handy for CI.

> Note: A `coverage` folder will be generated in the root of the project with a few reports related to the testing coverage in the project.
